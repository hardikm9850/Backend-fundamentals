## Details for Each API Type

### RESTful APIs
- **Description**: Representational State Transfer uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and resources identified by URLs.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simplicity and flexibility
  - Wide adoption
  - Stateless and scalable
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Overhead in HTTP headers
  - Less efficient for complex queries
- **Use Cases**: Web services, mobile apps, and backend communication

---

### Simple JSON APIs
- **Description**: Lightweight APIs that use JSON for request and response payloads.
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to use and parse
  - Minimal overhead
  - Language-agnostic
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Lacks formal structure like REST
  - Limited metadata capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Lightweight communication, IoT devices

---

### SOAP APIs
- **Description**: Simple Object Access Protocol uses XML for messages and strict standards for security and structure.
- **Advantages**:
  - Strong security (WS-Security)
  - Formal and standardized
  - Reliable (ACID transactions supported)
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Verbose XML payloads
  - Higher complexity
  - Requires strict adherence to standards
- **Use Cases**: Enterprise systems, banking, and payment processing

---

### GraphQL APIs
- **Description**: Query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly what they need in a single query.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexible queries
  - Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching
  - Strongly typed schema
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Complex server setup
  - Query complexity can lead to performance issues
- **Use Cases**: Frontend-heavy applications, modern app development

---

### gRPC APIs
- **Description**: Remote procedure call framework that uses Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization and communication.
- **Advantages**:
  - High performance
  - Strongly typed
  - Supports bidirectional streaming
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires Protocol Buffers
  - Not human-readable
  - Steeper learning curve
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, real-time systems, and internal services
