# Backend & Cloud Development Roadmap 

## Overview
This is a roadmap I put together to guide my journey in **Backend Engineering** and **Cloud Development**. 

---

## 1️⃣ Backend Engineering Roadmap
*(Goal: Build reliable, scalable backend systems using Golang & microservices)*

### 🟢 Phase 1: Fundamentals
- [x] Get comfortable with Go (syntax, data structures, error handling)
- [x] Learn how HTTP, REST, and WebSockets work
- [x] Work with databases: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) & NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)
- [x] Build simple CRUD APIs using Go (Gin/Fiber)
- [x] Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- [x] Watch **Fundamentals of Backend Engineering - Hussein Nasser** for core concepts
- [ ] **Goroutines** – Optimizing performance with concurrency in Go

### 🟡 Phase 2: Scalable Backend Design
- [ ] Understand API versioning & best practices
- [ ] Use middleware & request validation effectively
- [ ] Implement rate limiting & security measures (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Optimize performance with caching (Redis)
- [ ] Work with message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async processing
- [ ] **Context** – Managing request lifecycle in Go
- [ ] **Unit Testing** – Writing testable and maintainable code

### 🟠 Phase 3: Microservices & Advanced Topics
- [ ] Learn when to use Monolith vs. Microservices
- [ ] Implement service-to-service communication (gRPC, event-driven patterns)
- [ ] Set up logging & monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)
- [ ] Explore load balancing & horizontal scaling techniques
- [ ] Optimize performance with profiling and concurrency
- [ ] **Kafka** – Event-driven architecture & message brokering
- [ ] **MQTT** – Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT & real-time apps

## 2️⃣ Cloud Development Roadmap
*(Goal: Deploy & scale backend applications on AWS efficiently)*

### 🟢 Phase 1: Cloud Basics
- [ ] Learn core AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM)
- [ ] Deploy a Go app manually on an EC2 instance
- [ ] Use S3 for file storage (e.g., user uploads, logs)
- [ ] Understand IAM roles & permissions

### 🟡 Phase 2: Deployment & Automation
- [ ] Containerize and deploy Go apps with **Docker** & **ECS (Fargate)**
- [ ] Use **AWS API Gateway** to expose services securely
- [ ] Manage databases using **RDS** or **DynamoDB**
- [ ] Set up logging & monitoring with **CloudWatch**
- [ ] Automate deployments using **CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline)**

### 🟠 Phase 3: Scaling & Serverless
- [ ] Implement load balancing with **AWS ALB**
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling for backend services
- [ ] Explore **serverless computing (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)**
- [ ] Dive into Kubernetes with **AWS EKS**
- [ ] Manage infrastructure as code using **Terraform/CDK**

## How I Plan to Tackle This
-  **Start with Backend Phase 1 & 2**, focusing on building solid APIs
-  **Parallelly explore AWS Phase 1**, deploying my Go-Bikes project
-  **Move to advanced backend concepts while applying cloud strategies**

I hope this roadmap will help me stay on track and help me gain hands-on experience with Go and AWS.
